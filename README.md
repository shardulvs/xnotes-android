## Features

- **Ink that feels like a pen**: pressure-sensitive and low latency, with pens and highlighters.
- **Neon glow**: make any pen glow.
- **Disappearing ink**: ink that fades away on its own, great for teaching and presenting.
- **Shape snapping**: draw a rough shape, hold, and it snaps clean.
- **Sharp at any zoom**: ink and PDFs stay crisp however far you zoom in.
- **Notebooks and an infinite canvas**: pages when you want structure, endless space when you don't.
- **Book layouts**: single, double or cover pages, scrolling or page flips.
- **PDF import**: bring in any PDF and write all over it.
- **Room for side notes**: widen a PDF's margins on any edge and take notes on the side.
- **PDF text markups**: highlight, underline and strike out text, add comments, search it.
- **PDF colour filters**: invert, sepia, contrast, brightness, multiply and screen.
- **Images stay untouched**: filter a PDF and its photos and images keep their true colours.
- **Dark and OLED modes**: easy on the eyes at night, true black on OLED screens.
- **Real PDF export**: sharp vector output with selectable text, links and bookmarks.
- **Markdown**: write in markdown and it formats as you type.
- **Typed notes**: tables, LaTeX equations and code highlighting, right on the page.
- **20+ page templates**: Cornell, planners, music staves, isometric and more.
- **Endless themes**: any accent colour, eight styles for each, dual tone and Material You.
- **Make it yours**: rearrange the toolbar, float it or dock it on any edge, and pick its size.
- **Split view**: two notes side by side.
- **A real file explorer**: grid, gallery, list, column and timeline views, with plenty to customise.
- **Your notes, your folders**: notes are saved as files in a folder you choose, not locked away in an app's database, so you stay in full control of them.
- **Works with stylus pens**: S Pen and many others.
- **Always editable**: nothing gets flattened, so every stroke can be moved, restyled or erased later.
- **Private**: open source, no account, no ads, no tracking, no permissions.
